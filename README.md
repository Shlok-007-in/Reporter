*Real-time, crowdsourced Internet outage reporting platform for India
Reporter helps users monitor and visualize the state of internet connectivity across India powered entirely by community reports. 
It transforms user feedback into a live, color-coded map that shows where networks are slow, down, or working normally.*

🎯 Overview

Reporter brings transparency to India’s connectivity by letting users share what they experience — in real time.

Users can:
Report Internet Issues: Choose ISP (Jio, Airtel, Vi, BSNL, MTNL), select network type (2G/3G/4G/5G), mark their location, and report their status (Normal, Slow, or Down).
View Live Reports: Instantly see reports on an interactive map:

🟢 Normal

🟠 Slow

🔴 Down
Track Outage Patterns: Identify which regions and networks face recurring issues.
Verify Problems: Know immediately if it’s just your area or a widespread issue.
The result is a transparent, community-powered view of India’s network reliability.
